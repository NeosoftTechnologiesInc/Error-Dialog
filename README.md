# Error-Dialog

Displays a revamped error dialog to the user which improve the capabilities by offering to :
- copy the error code & message into the clipboard.
- open the search ni.com for the error code.
- add screenshot (error popup or full screen) feature.
- display either a dialog box with a single close window option (after the user acknowledges the dialog box, the VI returns control to the main VI) or a dialog box with buttons, which the user can use to either continue or stop (if the user selects Stop, the VI calls the Stop function to halt execution).
